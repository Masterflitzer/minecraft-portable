# Minecraft Portable

## Windows

-   Download the script and save it (e.g. on an usb drive: `x:/minecraft/minecraft-portable.ps1`)
-   Run the powershell script `minecraft-portable.ps1` (right-click and **Run with PowerShell**)

If your ExecutionPolicy doesn't allow the script to run, execute these commands in PowerShell and try again:

-   `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
-   `Unblock-File "x:/minecraft/minecraft-portable.ps1"`
