# Minecraft Portable

## Windows

-   Download the script and save it (e.g. on an usb drive: `x:/minecraft/minecraft-portable.ps1`)
-   Run the powershell script **minecraft-portable.ps1**

If your ExecutionPolicy doesn't allow the script to run, execute these commands in PowerShell as Administrator and try again:

-   `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`
-   `Unblock-File "x:/minecraft/minecraft-portable.ps1"`

Alternatively run the cmd wrapper **minecraft-portable.cmd**
